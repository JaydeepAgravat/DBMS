    4. The genres should be printed in alphabetical order.

    ```SQL
    SELECT T2.genre, MAX((T1.Rating+T1.MetaCritic/10)/2) AS  weighted_rating FROM imdb T1
    INNER JOIN genre T2
    ON T1.Movie_id = T2.Movie_id

    ```SQL
    SELECT  T2.genre, MAX(T3.Domestic + T3.Worldwide - T1.Budget) AS net_profit FROM imdb T1
    NATURAL JOIN genre T2
    NATURAL JOIN earning T3
    WHERE T2.genre IS NOT NULL AND SUBSTRING(Title, LOCATE('(', Title) + 1, 4) = '2012'

    | ad_id       | int  |
    | customer_id | int  |
    | timestamp   | int  |

    ad_id is the primary key for this table.
    customer_id is the ID of the customer viewing this ad.
    timestamp is the moment of time at which the ad was shown.

    Return the result table in any order.

    The query result format is in the following example:

    Playback table:

    | session_id | customer_id | start_time | end_time |
    | ---------- | ----------- | ---------- | -------- |
    | 1          | 1           | 1          | 5        |
    | 2          | 1           | 15         | 23       |
    | 3          | 2           | 10         | 12       |
    | 4          | 2           | 17         | 28       |
    | 5          | 2           | 2          | 8        |

    Ads table:

    | ad_id | customer_id | timestamp |
    | ----- | ----------- | --------- |
    | 1     | 1           | 5         |
    | 2     | 2           | 17        |
    | 3     | 2           | 20        |

    Result table:

    | session_id |
    | ---------- |
    | 2          |
    | 3          |
    | 5          |

    The ad with ID 1 was shown to user 1 at time 5 while they were in session 1.

    The ad with ID 2 was shown to user 2 at time 17 while they were in session 4.

    The ad with ID 3 was shown to user 2 at time 20 while they were in session 4.

    We can see that sessions 1 and 4 had at least one ad. Sessions 2, 3, and 5 did not have any ads, so we return them.

    ```SQL
    SELECT DISTINCT session_id FROM playback 
    NATURAL JOIN ads
    WHERE timestamp < start_time
    OR timestamp > end_time
    ORDER BY session_id
    ```

20. Write an SQL query to find the ids of products that are both low fat and recyclable.

    Table: Products

    | Column Name | Type  |
    | ----------- | ----- |
    | product_id  | int   |
    | low_fats    | enum  |
    | recyclable  | enum  |

    product_id is the primary key for this table.

    low_fats is an ENUM of type ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is low fat and 'N' means it is not.

    recyclable is an ENUM of types ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is recyclable and 'N' means it is not.

    Return the result table in any order.

    The query result format is in the following example:

    Products table:

    | product_id  | low_fats | recyclable |
    | ----------- | -------- | ---------- |
    | 0           | Y        | N          |
    | 1           | Y        | Y          |
    | 2           | N        | Y          |
    | 3           | Y        | Y          |
    | 4           | N        | N          |

    Result table:

    | product_id  |
    | ----------- |
    | 1           |
    | 3           |

    Only products 1 and 3 are both low fat and recyclable.

    ```SQL
    SELECT product_id FROM products
    WHERE low_fats='Y' and recyclable='Y'
    ```

21. Write a SQL query to find all duplicate emails in a table named Person.

    | Id | Email   |
    | -- | ------- |
    | 1  | ab.com |
    | 2  | cd.com |
    | 3  | ab.com |

    For example, your query should return the following for the above table:

    | Email   |
    | ------- |
    | ab.com |

    ```SQL
    SELECT Email FROM Person
    GROUP BY Email
    HAVING COUNT(*)>1
    ```

22. Write an SQL query to find the customer_number for the customer who has placed the largest number of orders.

    Table: Orders

    | Column Name     | Type |
    | --------------- | ---- |
    | order_number    | int  |
    | customer_number | int  |

    order_number is the primary key for this table.
    This table contains information about the order ID and the customer ID.

    It is guaranteed that exactly one customer will have placed more orders than any other customer.

    The query result format is in the following example:

    Orders table:

    | order_number | customer_number |
    | ------------ | ---------------- |
    | 1            | 1                |
    | 2            | 2                |
    | 3            | 3                |
    | 4            | 3                |

    Result table:

    | customer_number |
    | ---------------- |
    | 3               |

    The customer with number 3 has two orders, which is greater than either customer 1 or 2 because each of them only has one order.
    So the result is customer_number 3.

    ```SQL
    SELECT customer_number FROM Orders
    GROUP BY customer_number
    ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
    LIMIT 1
    ```

23. A pupil Tim gets homework to identify whether three line segments could possibly form a triangle.

    However, this assignment is very heavy because there are hundreds of records to calculate.

    Could you help Tim by writing a query to judge whether these three  sides can form a triangle, assuming table triangle holds the length of the three sides x, y and z.

    |  x  |  y  |  z  |
    |----|----|----|
    | 13 | 15 | 30 |
    | 10 | 20 | 15 |

    For the sample data above, your query should return the follow result:

    |  x  |  y  |  z  | triangle |
    |----|----|----|----------|
    | 13 | 15 | 30 | No       |
    | 10 | 20 | 15 | Yes      |

    ```SQL
    SELECT x, y, z,
    CASE
        WHEN x + y > z AND x + z > y AND y + z > x THEN 'Yes'
        ELSE 'No'
    END AS triangle
    FROM triangle
    ```

24. Write an SQL query to find the most frequently ordered product(s) for each customer.

    Table: Customers

    | Column Name   | Type    |
    | ------------- | ------- |
    | customer_id   | int     |
    | name          | varchar |

    customer_id is the primary key for this table.
    This table contains information about the customers.

    Table: Orders

    | Column Name   | Type  |
    | ------------- | ----- |
    | order_id      | int   |
    | order_date    | date  |
    | customer_id   | int   |
    | product_id    | int   |

    order_id is the primary key for this table.
    This table contains information about the orders made by customer_id.
    No customer will order the same product more than once in a single day.

    Table: Products

    | Column Name   | Type    |
    | ------------- | ------- |
    | product_id    | int     |
    | product_name  | varchar |
    | price         | int     |

    product_id is the primary key for this table.
    This table contains information about the products.

    The result table should have the product_id and product_name for each customer_id who ordered at least one order. Return the result table in any order.

    The query result format is in the following example:

    Customers

    | customer_id | name  |
    | ----------- | ----- |
    | 1           | Alice |
    | 2           | Bob   |

    | 9        | 2020-08-07 | 2           | 3          |
    | 10       | 2020-07-15 | 1           | 2          |

    Products

    | product_id | product_name | price |
    | ---------- | ------------ | ----- |
    | 1          | keyboard     | 120   |
    | 2          | mouse        | 80    |
    | 3          | screen       | 600   |
    | 4          | hard disk    | 450   |

    Result table:

    | customer_id | product_id | product_name |
    | ----------- | ---------- | ------------ |
    | 1           | 2          | mouse        |
    | 2           | 1          | keyboard     |
    | 2           | 2          | mouse        |
    | 2           | 3          | screen       |
    | 3           | 3          | screen       |
    | 4           | 1          | keyboard     |

    Alice (customer 1) ordered the mouse three times and the keyboard one time, so the mouse is the most frquently ordered product for them.

    Bob (customer 2) ordered the keyboard, the mouse, and the screen one time, so those are the most frquently ordered products for them.

    Tom (customer 3) only ordered the screen (two times), so that is the most frquently ordered product for them.

    Jerry (customer 4) only ordered the keyboard (one time), so that is the most frquently ordered product for them.

    John (customer 5) did not order anything, so we do not include them in the result table.

    ```SQL
    WITH ProductCounts AS (
    SELECT
        o.customer_id,
        o.product_id,
        p.product_name,
        COUNT(*) AS order_count
    FROM Orders o
    JOIN Products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id
    GROUP BY o.customer_id, o.product_id, p.product_name
    )

    SELECT customer_id, product_id, product_name
    FROM (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        product_id,
        product_name,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_count DESC) AS rnk
    FROM ProductCounts
    ) AS ranked
    WHERE rnk = 1
    ORDER BY customer_id, product_id
    ```

25. Write an SQL query to find the npv of all each query of queries table.

    Table: NPV

    | Column Name | Type |
    | ----------- | ---- |
    | id          | int  |
    | year        | int  |
    | npv         | int  |

    (id, year) is the primary key of this table.
    The table has information about the id and the year of each inventory and the corresponding net present value.

    Table: Queries

    | Column Name | Type |
    | ----------- | ---- |
    | id          | int  |
    | year        | int  |

    (id, year) is the primary key of this table.
    The table has information about the id and the year of each inventory query.

    Return the result table in any order.

    The query result format is in the following example:

    NPV table:

    | id   | year | npv |
    | ---- | ---- | --- |
    | 1    | 2018 | 100 |
    | 7    | 2020 | 30  |
    | 13   | 2019 | 40  |
    | 1    | 2019 | 113 |
    | 2    | 2008 | 121 |
    | 3    | 2009 | 12  |
    | 11   | 2020 | 99  |
    | 7    | 2019 | 0   |

    Queries table:

    | id   | year |
    | ---- | ---- |
    | 1    | 2019 |
    | 2    | 2008 |
    | 3    | 2009 |
    | 7    | 2018 |
    | 7    | 2019 |
    | 7    | 2020 |
    | 13   | 2019 |

    Result table:

    | id   | year | npv |

    | 7    | 2020 | 30  |
    | 13   | 2019 | 40  |

    The npv value of (7, 2018) is not present in the NPV table, we consider it 0.

    The npv values of all other queries can be found in the NPV table.

    ```SQL
    SELECT queries.id, queries.year,
    COALESCE(npv.npv, 0) AS npv
    FROM queries
    LEFT JOIN npv ON queries.id = npv.id AND queries.year = npv.year
    ```
