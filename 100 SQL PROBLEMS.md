    INNER JOIN genre T2
    ON T1.Movie_id = T2.Movie_id

    NATURAL JOIN genre T2
    NATURAL JOIN earning T3
    WHERE T2.genre IS NOT NULL AND SUBSTRING(Title, LOCATE('(', Title) + 1, 4) = '2012'

    | SecondHighestSalary |
    | ------------------- |
    |         200         |

8. Write an SQL query to find all dates' id with higher temperature compared to its previous dates (yesterday). Return the result table in any order.

    | recordDate      | date     |
    | temperature     | int      |

    id is the primary key for this table.

    This table contains information about the temperature in a certain day.

    The query result format is in the following example:

    Weather:

    |  id  | recordDate | Temperature |
    | ---  | ---------- | ----------- |
    |  1   | 2015-01-01 |     10      |

    Result table:

    |  Id  |
    | ---  |
    |  2   |
    |  4   |

    ```SQL
    SELECT T.id
    FROM (
    SELECT *, (Temperature > LAG(Temperature) OVER (ORDER BY RecordDate)) AS isBig
    FROM weather
    ) AS T
    WHERE isBig = TRUE;
    ```
